# Note : because two cameras are successively involved in the full process of this application,
# power measure needs two rendering iterations to be computed (2 standard panda igLoop tasks)
#  - remote_control_server changes something in settings
#  - nodes are updated accordingly
#  - sun is rendered on mirrors 'measure_surface' (FIRST required igLoop iteration)
#  - mirrors 'measure_camera' record 'measure_surface' in 'measure_texture'
#  - mirrors sun_reflection_projector project 'measure_texture' on reflection receiver
#  - sun reflection are rendered on reflection receiver (SECOND required igLoop iteration)
#  - measure_area 'measure_camera' record measure_rectangle and count power
# So we define the following constant to count down the panda loop execution between the request reception and the measure reply
